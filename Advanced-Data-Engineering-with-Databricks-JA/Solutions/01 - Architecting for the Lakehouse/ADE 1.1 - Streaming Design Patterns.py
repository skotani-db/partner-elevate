# MAGIC # Streaming Design Patterns
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Lakehouse has been designed from the beginning to work seamlessly with datasets that grow infinitely over time. While Spark Structured Streaming is often positioned as a near real-time data processing solution, it combines with Delta Lake to also provide easy batch processing of incremental data while drastically simplifying the overhead required to track data changes over time.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC By the end of this lessons, student will be able to:
# MAGIC - Use Structured Streaming to complete simple incremental ETL
# MAGIC - Perform incremental writes to multiple tables
# MAGIC - Incrementally update values in a key value store
# MAGIC - Process Change Data Capture (CDC) data into Delta Tables using **`MERGE`**
# MAGIC - Join two incremental tables
# MAGIC - Join incremental and batch tables

# MAGIC ## Simple Incremental ETL
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Likely the highest volume of data being processed by most organizations could largely be describing as moving data from one location to another while applying light transformations and validations. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As most source data continues to grow as time passes, it's appropriate to refer to this data as incremental (sometimes also referred to as streaming data). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Structured Streaming and Delta Lake make incremental ETL easy. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Below we'll create a simple table and insert some values.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC
# MAGIC CREATE TABLE bronze 
# MAGIC (id INT, name STRING, value DOUBLE); 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC INSERT INTO bronze
# MAGIC VALUES (1, "Yve", 1.0),
# MAGIC        (2, "Omar", 2.5),
# MAGIC        (3, "Elia", 3.3)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The following cell defines an incremental read on the table just created using Structured Streaming, adds a field to capture when the record was processed, and writes out to a new table as a single batch.

# COMMAND ----------

def update_silver():
    query = (spark.readStream
                  .table("bronze")
                  .withColumn("processed_time", F.current_timestamp())
                  .writeStream.option("checkpointLocation", f"{DA.paths.checkpoints}/silver")
                  .trigger(availableNow=True)
                  .table("silver"))
    
    query.awaitTermination()


# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC While this code uses Structured Streaming, it's appropriate to think of this as a triggered batch processing incremental changes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_note_32.png"></img>
# MAGIC To facilitate the demonstration of structured streams, we are using **`trigger(availableNow=True)`** to slow
# MAGIC down the processing of the data combined with **`query.awaitTermination()`** to prevent the lesson from
# MAGIC moving forward until the one batch is processed.  **trigger-available-now** is very similar to **trigger-once** but can run
# MAGIC multiple batches until all available data is consumed instead of once big batch and is introduced in
# MAGIC <a href="https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-3-0.html" target="_blank">Spark 3.3.0</a> and

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As expected, the stream runs for a very brief time, and the **`silver`** table written contains all the values previously written to **`bronze`**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC SELECT * FROM silver

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Processing new records is as easy as adding them to our source table **`bronze`**...

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Writing to Multiple Tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Those familiar with Structured Streaming may be aware that the **`foreachBatch`** method provides the option to execute custom data writing logic on each microbatch of streaming data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Databricks Runtime provides guarantees that these <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/delta/delta-streaming.html#idempot-write" target="_blank">streaming Delta Lake writes will be idempotent</a>, even when writing to multiple tables, IF you set the "txnVersion" and "txnAppId" options. This is especially useful when data for multiple tables might be contained within a single record.  This was added in <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/8.4.html" target="_blank">Databricks Runtime 8.4</a>.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The code below first defines the custom writer logic to append records to two new tables, and then demonstrates using this function within **`foreachBatch`**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There is some debate as to whether you should use foreachBatch to write to multiple tables or to simply use multiple streams.  Generally multiple streams is the simpler and more efficient design because it allows streaming jobs writing to each table to run independently of each other.  Whereas using foreachBatch to write to multiple tables has the advantage of keeping writes to the two tables in sync.

# COMMAND ----------

def write_twice(microBatchDF, batchId):
    appId = "write_twice"
    
    microBatchDF.select("id", "name", F.current_timestamp().alias("processed_time")).write.option("txnVersion", batchId).option("txnAppId", appId).mode("append").saveAsTable("silver_name")
    
    microBatchDF.select("id", "value", F.current_timestamp().alias("processed_time")).write.option("txnVersion", batchId).option("txnAppId", appId).mode("append").saveAsTable("silver_value")


def split_stream():
    query = (spark.readStream.table("bronze")
                 .writeStream
                 .foreachBatch(write_twice)
                 .option("checkpointLocation", f"{DA.paths.checkpoints}/split_stream")
                 .trigger(availableNow=True)
                 .start())
    
    query.awaitTermination()
    

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that while a stream will again be triggered, the two writes contained within the **`write_twice`** function are using Spark batch syntax. This will always be the case for writers called by **`foreachBatch`**.

# COMMAND ----------

split_stream()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The cells below demonstrate the logic was applied properly to split the initial data into two tables.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM silver_name
# MAGIC ORDER BY processed_time DESC, id DESC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that the **`processed_time`** for each of these tables differs slightly. The logic defined above captures the current timestamp at the time each write executes, demonstrating that while both writes happen within the same streaming microbatch process, they are fully independent transactions (as such, downstream logic should be tolerant for slightly asynchronous updates).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM silver_value
# MAGIC ORDER BY processed_time DESC, id DESC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Insert more values into the **`bronze`** table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC INSERT INTO bronze
# MAGIC VALUES (7, "Viktor", 7.4),
# MAGIC        (8, "Hiro", 8.2),
# MAGIC        (9, "Shana", 9.9)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC And we can now pick up these new records and write to two tables.

# COMMAND ----------

split_stream()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As expected, only new values are inserted into the two tables, again a few moments apart.

# MAGIC ## Update Aggregates in a Key-Value Store
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Incremental aggregation can be useful for a number of purposes, including dashboarding and enriching reports with current summary data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The logic below defines a handful of aggregations against the **`silver`** table.

# COMMAND ----------

def update_key_value():
    query = (spark.readStream
                  .table("silver")
                  .groupBy("id")
                  .agg(F.sum("value").alias("total_value"), 
                       F.mean("value").alias("avg_value"),
                       F.count("value").alias("record_count"))
                  .writeStream
                  .option("checkpointLocation", f"{DA.paths.checkpoints}/key_value")
                  .outputMode("complete")
                  .trigger(availableNow=True)
                  .table("key_value"))
    
    query.awaitTermination()
    

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **NOTE**: Because the transformations above require shuffling data, setting the number of shuffle partitions to the maximum number of cores will provide more efficient performance. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The default number of shuffle partitions (200) can cripple many streaming jobs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As such, it's a reasonably good practice to simply use the maximum number of cores as the high end, and if smaller, maintain a factor of the number of cores.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Naturally, this generalized advice changes as you increase the number of streams running on a single cluster.

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"Executor cores: {sc.defaultParallelism}")
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", sc.defaultParallelism)

# COMMAND ----------

update_key_value()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM key_value
# MAGIC ORDER BY id

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC Adding more values to the **`silver`** table will allow more interesting aggregation.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC INSERT INTO silver
# MAGIC VALUES (1, "Yve", 1.0, current_timestamp()),

# MAGIC        (7, "Viktor", 7.4, current_timestamp()),
# MAGIC        (8, "Hiro", 8.2, current_timestamp()),
# MAGIC        (9, "Shana", 9.9, current_timestamp())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC One thing to note is that the logic being executed is currently overwriting the resulting table with each write. In the next section, **`MERGE`** will be used in combination with **`foreachBatch`** to update existing records. This pattern can also be applied with key-value stores.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Processing Change Data Capture Data
# MAGIC While the change data capture (CDC) data emitted by various systems will vary greatly, incrementally processing these data with Databricks is straightforward.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here the **`bronze_status`** table will represent the raw CDC information, rather than row-level data.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC CREATE TABLE bronze_status 
# MAGIC (user_id INT, status STRING, update_type STRING, processed_timestamp TIMESTAMP);
# MAGIC
# MAGIC INSERT INTO bronze_status
# MAGIC VALUES  (1, "new", "insert", current_timestamp()),
# MAGIC         (2, "repeat", "update", current_timestamp()),
# MAGIC         (3, "at risk", "update", current_timestamp()),
# MAGIC         (4, "churned", "update", current_timestamp()),
# MAGIC         (5, null, "delete", current_timestamp())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The **`silver_status`** table below has been created to track the current **`status`** for a given **`user_id`**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC CREATE TABLE silver_status (user_id INT, status STRING, updated_timestamp TIMESTAMP)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The **`MERGE`** statement can easily be written with SQL to apply CDC changes appropriately, given the type of update received.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The rest of the **`upsert_cdc`** method contains the logic necessary to run SQL code against a micro-batch in a PySpark DataStreamWriter.
